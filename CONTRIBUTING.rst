Style Guide
-----------
All pull requests to the python source must follow `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ conventions.

In addition, all methods and functions must be in snake_case and not camelCase. This to keep things uniform across all modules. This should also help make identifying PyQt5 methods easier.


Issues
------

When opening new issues, if it is a bug, make sure to describe the bug in as detail as possible and some steps to reproduce the bug. If it's a feature or an enhancement, explain why it is needed.

`#5 <https://github.com/daegontaven/AlphaHooks/issues/5#issue-247267430>`_ is a good example of nicely formatted issue.
