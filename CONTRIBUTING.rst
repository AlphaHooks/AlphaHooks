Style Guide
-----------
All pull requests to the python source must follow `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ conventions.

In addition, all methods and functions must be in snake_case and not camelCase. This to keep things uniform across all modules. This should also help make identifying PyQt5 methods easier.
